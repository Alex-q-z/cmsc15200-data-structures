# uchicago-cs152-project
This is the home for my UChicago CS 15200 Traversal Codes and Final Project.  
The page is under construction. (Since the author is having his final.)

# traversal_codes
This is a C file for realizing various traversal operations.  

# image_compression
This project features a new file format (.p152) for ppm file compression.

1. negative.c  
- The negative of an image is produced by subtracting the value of each color component from 255.  
That is, the negative of the color (10,20,30) is (245,235,225). Similarly, the negative of  
(255,255,255) is (0,0,0) and vice versa. The program would read an image from stdin and write  
the corresponding negative to stdout. It supports both P3 and P6 files, and write the same format it reads.

2. describe.c  
The program "describe" reads a P152 file from stdin and writes the following information to stdout:
- the date embedded in the file
- the time embedded in the file
- the string description embedded in the file
- the dimensions of the image
- whether of not the image uses run-length encoding
- whether or not the image is grayscale
- whether or not the image uses a color table, and, if, so, the size of the table

3. ppm_p152.c & p152_ppm.c
A p152 file has the following structure:

- byte 0:5  
The first six bytes of a P152v1 file contain the characters "P152v1".  

- byte 6:7  
The two bytes are reserved for future expansion. For the time being,  
they can contain anything. The same is true of any other bits and  
bytes identified below as reserved for future expansion.  

- byte 8:11  
These bytes contain the current date as a YYYYMMDD integer (for  
example, 20190228). This should be the date at which the conversion  
to P152 is performed. Type "man localtime" to read about the various  
ways to read the current date from the system. This number is written  
into the file as a 4-byte big-endian integer.  

- byte 12:13  
The current time is given as an HHMM integer. For example: 0 is\
midnight, 930 is 9:30am, 1345 is 1:45pm. The time should be the\
minute at which the P152 conversion is performed. This is written\
into the file as a two-byte big-endian integer.\

- byte 14:15  
The image width is written as a 2-byte big-endian integer.  

- byte 16:17  
The image height is given as a 2-byte big-endian integer.  

- byte 18:21  
These bytes store the color table size.

- byte 22  
The leftmost bit -- the highest bit -- of byte 22 is 1 for run-length  
encoded color data, 0 for raw data. 
The next-to-leftmost bit of byte 22 is 1 for a grayscale image, 0 for  
color.  
The next 6 bits in byte 22 are reserved for future expansion.  

- byte 23:25  
Reserved for future expansion.  

- starting at byte 26:  
A C string describing the image, terminated with a '\0'. Because the  
file includes a terminating character, the string can be any length.  

- following the string:  
The color table. This is unused in the current project. Write four  
zero bytes in the color table section for now.  

- following the color table:  
First, a 4-byte big-endian integer giving the number of runs.  
Then, the run lengths in order, each run length a 4-byte big-endian  
integer.  
Then, the colors in order and in lockstep with the runs. If the image  
is a grayscale image, these colors are one byte each; otherwise, they  
are three bytes each in rgb order.
